## Markdown Style Guide for Coding Notebooks

Follow this guide to keep your coding notebook **clear, consistent, and professional**.  
This ensures your notes are easy for you (and others) to read later.

---

## 🔹 Headings
**When to use:** Organize your notebook into sections (like days, topics, or projects).  
- `#` for the notebook title (use once at the top).  
- `##` for each day or major topic.  
- `###` for subsections (like "Notes", "Practice", "Reflections").  

✅ Example:
```markdown
# My Coding Notebook
## Day 1
### Notes
### Practice
🔡 Text Formatting
When to use: Highlight important ideas or add emphasis.

Use bold for key terms or definitions.

Use italic for emphasis or side comments.

Use inline code for keywords, functions, or commands.

✅ Example:

markdown
Copy code
**Class** = a blueprint for objects  
*Remember:* always test your code  
Use `System.out.println()` to print
💻 Code Blocks
When to use: Anytime you write multiple lines of code.

Inline code for short snippets.

Fenced code blocks with language for full examples.

✅ Example:

markdown
Copy code
```java
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```
🧾 Lists
When to use: Organize steps, notes, or key points.

Numbered lists for sequences or steps.

Bulleted lists for unordered ideas.

✅ Example:

markdown
Copy code
1. Define the class
2. Write the main method
3. Test your program

- Variables
- Loops
- Conditionals
✅ Checklists
When to use: Track progress on assignments or tasks.

✅ Example:

markdown
Copy code
- [x] Complete coding warm-up
- [ ] Finish project draft
- [ ] Reflect on learning
➡️ Blockquotes
When to use: Call out notes, reminders, or teacher comments.

✅ Example:

markdown
Copy code
> 💡 Remember: Loops repeat code until a condition is false.
📊 Tables
When to use: Compare values, track progress, or organize data neatly.

✅ Example:

markdown
Copy code
| Task        | Status   | Notes          |
|-------------|----------|----------------|
| Homework 1  | Done ✅  | Submitted      |
| Homework 2  | Pending  | Needs review   |
🔗 Links & Images
When to use: Add references, resources, or visuals.

✅ Example:

markdown
Copy code
[Java Docs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/)  
![Markdown Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Markdown-mark.svg)
📂 Collapsible Sections
When to use: Hide solutions, extended notes, or extra details.

✅ Example:

markdown
Copy code
<details>
  <summary>Click to reveal solution</summary>
  
System.out.println("Answer: 42");

bash
Copy code
</details>
📝 Footnotes
When to use: Add references or side notes without cluttering the page.

✅ Example:

markdown
Copy code
This concept is related to object-oriented programming.[^1]

🎯 Style Rules
Consistency matters more than creativity

Always use headings to structure your notes.

Always use code blocks for multi-line code.

Clarity first

Bold key terms.

Use lists instead of long sentences when outlining steps.

Professional tone

Don’t mix casual notes with formal work in the same section.

Use blockquotes for reflections or teacher feedback.

Track your learning

Use checklists to mark what’s done.

Use collapsible sections if you want to hide answers until review time.

✅ Bottom Line:

Headings = Structure

Bold/Italic = Emphasis

Code blocks = Code

Lists = Steps/Ideas

Tables = Organization

Checklists = Progress

Blockquotes = Notes/Tips

Collapsible = Hide/Show detail

Keep it simple, consistent, and clear.
